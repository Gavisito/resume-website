                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">My mission for the industry is creating user friendly interface that not only look amazing, 
                            but make the application easily accessible to those with specific needs to rightfully experience it as intended.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, I would love to work on projects that have an humanitarian aspect to them such as Non-Profit Organizations
                            and / or Mom and Pop shops as side-hussle, so I can give back to my community.

                        <h3>What I'm Searching For In My Career</h3>
                        <p>
                            I hope to find a company that shares the same level of care and interest about buidling user interfaces to
                             help me provide quality service experiences on their websites for user, while,
                              providing an environment where I can build upon my knowledge and skillset to
                              effectively make continuously improving experiences 
                              for all users
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                            Although, at the moment, I am front-end focused, I would like to, eventually, fine tune my skillset
                            in the back-end context to further enhance and compliment my front-end developmental skills. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                            I would also want to expand my capabilities within front-end development. Particularly, discovering new layout and 
                            components to utilize in personal and work contextes.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                            This can range from using CSS art, animations, Spline / Blender 3D model,etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, I want to create UI component library that gets new new components on interval basis.
                        </p>
